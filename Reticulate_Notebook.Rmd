First we'll import reticulate in an R code block:
```{r}
library(reticulate)
```

We can immediately start playing with python within a code block designated as python:
```{python}
import pandas as pd

print 'hello python'

some_dict = {'a':1, 'b':2, 'c':3}

print some_dict.keys()
```

With reticulate, we can also import any Python module and call that module from R:
```{r}
os <- import("os")
os$listdir(".")
```

We can also start a Python REPL (read-eval-print shell) within our session by calling repl_python() at console (see console)
```{r}
repl_python()
# below code at console
# import pandas as pd
# gages = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhweber/R-User-Group-Spatial-Workshop-2018/gh-pages/data/StreamGages.csv')
# gages.head()
# gages['STATE'].unique()
# 
```
