Slide 1
- If you're like me and you program in both R and Python, the R reticulate package may be one of the handiest packages to come along in some time
- I've actually been running python from R for some time now through code chunks in R markdown documents, where
I simply add the code chunk parameters engine='python', engine.path='C:/Python27/ArcGIS10.3/python.exe', but as you'll see in this overview reticulate adds lots of functionality and allows really powerful integration of R and Python

Slide 2
- I'm going to move into an R notebook and just do some live demos of the main features and approaches to using reticulate

Chunk 1 & 2
- To get started, load the reticulate library, and in an RMarkdown document or notebook, create a Python chunk, write your Python code, and run the code chunk
- Just as with r code chunks in RMarkdown, you get shared variables and state between Python chunks

Chunk 3
- We can directly import Python modules in R and access module functions and data via the '$' operator, for example to use Python os module to list directories
